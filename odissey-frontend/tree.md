## Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features:
- **Authentication System**: Guest login with session management and token validation
- **Personality System**: Rolling assessment, preference discovery, trait scoring, and recalibration
- **World Management**: Gallery browsing, creation initiation, co-creation workflow, and demo worlds
- **Session Management**: Story interactions, message history, persistence, and coherence tracking
- **Navigation Flow**: Intelligent routing based on authentication and personality completion status
- **Context Architecture**: Comprehensive state management with AuthContext, PersonalityContext, WorldContext, and SessionContext

### ðŸš§ Partially Implemented:
- **World Co-Creation**: Basic conversational interface implemented, needs backend integration for streaming responses
- **Rolling Personality Assessment**: Framework in place, needs LLM-powered analysis integration
- **Quick Play**: UI ready, needs <10 second optimization and personality-aware initialization

### ðŸ“‹ TODO:
- **Audio Integration**: Voice narration support
- **Visual Enhancements**: Character avatars, world thumbnails, animations
- **Advanced Analytics**: Engagement metrics, prompt effectiveness tracking
- **Content Safety**: Age-appropriate content validation
- **Algorithm-Based Matching**: Advanced world recommendation system

*This `tree.md` tracks the implementation progress and will be updated as features are completed and refined.*
