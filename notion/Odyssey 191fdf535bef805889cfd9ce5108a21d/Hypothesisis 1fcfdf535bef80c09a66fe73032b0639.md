The **first objective** of this thesis is to identify the **design requirements (DRs)** and **design principles (DPs)** necessary to shape a generative AI (GenAI) application in a way that **sustainably increases children's acceptance** of this technology (H1). A child-friendly adaptation of chatbots is intended to enable companies to offer more **personalized products and services**. By fostering **greater technological acceptance** among children, it is hoped that their **technological literacy** will improve—an advantage that could yield **competitive benefits** both for businesses and society at large. It is assumed that children may be more **GenAI-affine** than the average adult.

In addition to economic considerations, the proposed DRs and DPs aim to **increase the transparency** of GenAI systems. **Transparency** is one of the central research challenges in the field of GenAI. A key objective in current research and development is to **make AI decision-making processes more understandable and interpretable**—an approach known as **Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)**.

Most GenAI applications are based on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**—large-scale, pretrained statistical language models built on deep neural networks. These architectures are composed of highly complex, interconnected computational units. Due to this structural complexity, the internal decision-making mechanisms and resulting model outputs are often **not fully traceable**, leading to their classification as **“black box” systems**.

In this context, transparency can be promoted through **a better understanding of internal model dynamics**, as well as more **grounded interpretation and assessment** of generated outputs. This thesis aims to enhance transparency—and thus **safety and harmlessness**—of GenAI systems by implementing appropriate design requirements and principles through **personalization** (H2).

If conducting a study involving children is not feasible, an **alternative line of inquiry** can be pursued: **AI has the potential to replace routine tasks**, with the least impact expected in areas that require high levels of **creativity and novelty**. Based on this, the study will investigate how **creative performance** changes before and after the use of a **personalized GenAI application** (H3). To test this hypothesis, a comparison between two experimental conditions is proposed: a control group with using a standard ChatGPT model, and a group using a **personalized chatbot**.

The development of such an app would also allow for an investigation of the following: **To what extent does the sense of ownership and engagement change when a chatbot is personalized?** (H4)

In addition, this thesis aims to develop a **framework for building child-appropriate GenAI systems**, by: Identifying the **roles** (e.g., friend, mother, sibling, teacher) children assign to GenAI → which allows the derivation of different interaction strategies.

An exploratory research question (H5) is: **Is it possible to learn about how children dream** through their interaction with a **storytelling GenAI**?

**Are children more immersed and engaged** when interacting with **group-specific GenAI** as compared to a general system like ChatGPT? (H6)

Furthermore (H7): **Can generative AI foster users' creative self-expression** by helping them co-author stories in which they themselves are the main characters?

This leads to the overarching goal of developing a **framework** for enabling child–GenAI interaction in a way that **activates and sustains creativity**.

Based on **Flow Theory**—which describes the deep immersion people experience when fully engaged in an activity—the study also asks: **Does the attention span of children change through interaction with a storytelling chatbot? (H8)**
