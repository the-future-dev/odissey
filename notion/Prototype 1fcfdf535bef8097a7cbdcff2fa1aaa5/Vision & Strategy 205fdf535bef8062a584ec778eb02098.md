# Vision & Strategy

## Product Vision & Goals

### **Core Problem Solution**

Our application revolutionizes storytelling by enabling users to experience personalized, interactive narratives through AI generation. It addresses the demand for more entertaining content, that allows immersive mobile entertainment, transforming users from passive consumers into active story participants.

### **Story Coherence Strategy**

Consistency across both story creation and consumption is achieved through sophisticated system prompts that guide AI behavior, ensuring age-appropriate content while maintaining narrative thread through world artifacts (characters, settings, rules) that are persistently fed to the narrator at inference time.

### **Target Audience**

Our initial focus targets children aged 7â€“12 years old, a strategic choice based on their natural creativity, high engagement with interactive content, and potential for driving organic growth through family engagement. This foundation will allow for future expansion to other age groups.

<aside>
**The Story Consumer**: An entertainment seeker looking for personalized experiences beyond repetitive standard narratives. They have basic technical understanding and prefer consuming over creating content. The system provides instant gratification through ex: 30-second story previews, quick play (10-second access), and progressive revelation of story elements.

**The Story Creator**: A creative individual seeking expression through storytelling, who feels limited by traditional passive entertainment. They possess moderate to high technical proficiency and enjoy content creation. The system enables co-creation through GenAI guided by system prompts that stimulate inventive thinking without overwhelming options.
