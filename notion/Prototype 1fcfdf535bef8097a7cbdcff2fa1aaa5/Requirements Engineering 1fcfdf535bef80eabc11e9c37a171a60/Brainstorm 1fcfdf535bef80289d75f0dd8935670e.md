World Build Model

a cool functionality to have would be to shape a world by being fed a book / a pdf / a story / a text.

Ex: we feed the harry potter book and we can derive all the information to create a world where the user can interact with it.

## Go To Market

How do we want to go to market?

- Children. I don’t know many - ideas?
- Language. We should ensure correct language in the places we deploy.

I believe we should focus on a key center (ex: Stockholm). Ensure for example that the language works etc. and try the network effect (ex: all the highschools in Stockholm: we give flyers or something physical ex. some sort of playing cards related to the app).

## Social

The experience should be double:

- **story creation**: (World Building Engine) the person creating the experience. Is the one defining the world and the story around. The experience has to be around the “**writer**”. Ex: *J. K. Rowling in shaping the Harry Potter world*. Is it all defined a priori, or it gets defined while evolving the story? Both: a bit a priori, a bit shaped by the user evolving. The KEY here is that the user defines how the word works by interacting with it: there is need for creativity.

**World Building Engine**

Iterative, co-creation with AI, start with a prompt then back and forth towards shaping:

Characters / Rules / (Events?)

- **story consumption**: experience from the outside. “Interact” with the world somebody else has created. Ex: *Who would not like to go around in the Harry Potter world? Experience Hogwarts?*

## Personalization

- we have to get personality of the user interacting
    
    an extensive survey at the beginning
    
    evolve the personality profile through interaction
    

Ex: *in the Harry Potter world - a type of personality would like to be challenged by adversities and get against the bad Lord Voldemort, another type of personality instead might as well just live it trough peacefully.*

We need also the persons information in order to place the person as one character of an existing enviroment (Fits the user best to Harry Potter?)

- Onboarding quiz - ask about preferences
- Could be re-taken in profile

- **On-Boarding Quiz**
    
    idea fast to gather the key data of the person
    
- **Extensive Quiz**
    
    extensive quiz for personality assessment.
    
    - who is the user?
    - how would it react to particular situations?
    
    **IDEA**
    
    1. Basic Structure for standard testing: there exists a multitude of these, use the structure of one available
    2. Enhance with some AI generated questions to gather personality: a quiz that develops based on the answers
    

## Coherence in story shaping

how to maintain adherence to a story ground truth without annihilating creativity?

Idea: maintain three artifacts per interaction:

- the human - AI chat
- story grounding: fit a world based on the chat: characters, rules of the word, …
    
    this helps maintaining coherence
    
- shape a book in the background
